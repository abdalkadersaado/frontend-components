# Build a Tribute Page Project

## Objective

1. Build a CodePen app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx).
2. I can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this project.

## User Stories

1. My tribute page has an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains the title of the page.
2. My tribute page has a corresponding `h1` element with the `id="title"`, which contains the title of the page: Bertha Benz.
3. My tribute page contains an element with the id `id="img-div"`. Inside of it there is an image with a corresponding `id="image"` and a caption with the corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains text describing the image.
4. The `article` element that has the `id="tribute-info"` attribute, contains text describing the story of Bertha Benz.
5. Inside the `footer` element I've added a link with the `id="tribute-link"` which links to the Wikipedia that contains additional information about Bertha Benz.
6. Each `img` element can be responsively resive, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
7. The `img` element should be centered within its parent element.

## Testing

In order to test the requirements I've use [this](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) CDN link provided by freeCodeCamp.

## [Solution](https://codepen.io/alexandracaulea/full/MWwgbEv)

My tribute page is dedicated to [**Bertha Benz**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertha_Benz).

This project was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the images are lazy loaded using Intersection Observer API.
