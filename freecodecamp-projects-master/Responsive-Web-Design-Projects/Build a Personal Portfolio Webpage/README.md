# Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage Project

## Objective

1. Build a CodePen app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG).
2. I can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this project.

## User Stories

1. My portfolio should have a welcome section with an id of `welcome-section`.
2. The welcome section should have an `h1` element that contains text.
3. My portfolio should have a projects section with an id of `projects`.
4. The projects section should contain at least one element with a class of `project-tile` to hold a project.
5. The projects section should contain at least one link to a project.
6. My portfolio should have a `navbar` with an id of navbar.
7. The navbar should contain at least one link that I can click on to navigate to different sections of the page.
8. My portfolio should have a link with an id of `profile-link`, which opens my GitHub or FCC profile in a new tab.
9. My portfolio should have at least one media query.
10. The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport.
11. The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

## Testing

To test the requirements, I've use [this](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) CDN link provided by freeCodeCamp.

## [Solution](https://codepen.io/alexandracaulea/full/ZEbLxRG)

Since I had so many ideas on how to implement this project, I decided to first use Figma without touching any code.
In Figma I've created three frames: for mobile, tablet and desktop and tried different ideas.

After I've finished with Figma I've decided to start working on the project and experiment more in the browser.

I enjoyed so much working on this project so I've decided to also implement it on my website.

In this project I've experimented with CSS Grid, Lazy Loading images with fallback and with JavaScript in general.
