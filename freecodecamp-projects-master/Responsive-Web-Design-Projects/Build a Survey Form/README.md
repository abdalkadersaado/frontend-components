# Build a Survey Form Project

## Objective

1. Build a CodePen app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP).
2. I can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this project.

## User Stories

1. My Survey Form has a `h1` element with a corresponding `id="title"`, which contains the title of the page.
2. My Survey Form has a short explanation of the project which is wrapped inside of a paragraph with `id="description"`.
3. There should be a `form` tag with `id="survey-form"`.
4. Inside the `form` element, the name and email should be required and should have `id="name"` and `id="email"` respectively.
5. If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error and a custom JavaScript error.
6. If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
7. The name, email, and number input fields inside the form should have a corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: `id="name-label"`, `id="email-label"`, and `id="number-label"`.
8. The name, email, and number input fields, should have a placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.
9. Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown that has a corresponding `id="dropdown"`.
10. Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the `name` attribute.
11. Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a `value` attribute.
12. Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for additional comments.
13. Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with `id="submit"` to submit all my inputs.

## [Solution](https://codepen.io/alexandracaulea/full/YzXdNbY)

I've built a fully functional and accessible multi step product survey form with progress bar and custom JavaScript validation.

This project was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
