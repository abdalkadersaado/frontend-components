# Celsius to Fahrenheit Convertor Project

While going through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification curriculum I had to write an algorithm to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
I've decided to take this challenge a bit further and implement also an UI for it.

## User Stories

1. My convertor should have two `input` elements with the type of `number`.
2. Each input should have a coresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field.
3. I should be able to convert positive temperatures.
4. I should be able to convert negative temperatures.
5. The temperatures should be converted based on the formula: `(0°C × 9/5) + 32 = 32°F`.
6. My convertor should be responsive.
7. My convertor should be centered on the page.

## Testing

I've manual tested all the requirements.
