# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

In this section I had the chance to build the following projects:

1. Palindrome Checker - [See the code](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/freecodecamp-projects/blob/master/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects/Palindrome%20Checker/palindrome-checker.js)

- _In addition, I've implemented an UI, added more JavaScript functionality and I've integrated unit testing and end to end testing_ - [Link to the repository](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/palindrome-checker) - [Live example on GitHub](https://alexandracaulea.github.io/palindrome-checker/)

2. Roman Numeral Converter - [See the code](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/freecodecamp-projects/blob/master/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects/Roman%20Numeral%20Converter/roman-numeral-converter.js)

- _I've also implemented an UI, added more JavaScript functionality and tested my code using Jest._ - [Link to the repository](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/roman-converter) - [Live example on GitHub](https://alexandracaulea.github.io/roman-converter/)

3. Caesars Cipher - [See the code](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/freecodecamp-projects/blob/master/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects/Caesars%20Cipher/caesars-cipher.js)

4. Telephone Number Validator - [See the code](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/freecodecamp-projects/blob/master/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects/Telephone%20Number%20Validator/telephone-number-validator.js)

5. Cash Register - [See the code](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/freecodecamp-projects/blob/master/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects/Cash%20Register/cash-register.js)

## Additional projects _not required by the curriculum_:

1. While working through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification curriculum I had to write an algorithm to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. I've decided to take this challenge a bit further and implement also an UI for it. - [Live Example on CodePen](https://codepen.io/alexandracaulea/full/rNVKLor) - [See the code on GitHub](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/freecodecamp-projects/tree/master/JavaScript-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects/Celsius%20to%20Fahrenheit%20Convertor)

2. Practice writing tests in Jest - I've took all the challenges from the [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/) that I've already solved and wrote tests in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - [See the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/Intermediate-Algorithm-Scripting).

3. Palindrome Checker - I've implemented an UI, added more JavaScript functionality and I've integrated unit testing and end to end testing. - [Link to the repository](https://github.com/alexandracaulea/palindrome-checker) - [Live example on GitHub](https://alexandracaulea.github.io/palindrome-checker/).
